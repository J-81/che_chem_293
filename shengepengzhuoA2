What does the model achieve?
- Figure out the linear relationship between temperature and pressure of air
How should metrics be interpreted?
- The independent variable is temperature in the unit of Kelvin, and the dependent variable is pressure in the unit of Pascal
What are appropriate use cases?
- Temperature and pressure of a gas are typically two variables that fit with linear relationship, while applying ideal gas law. 
How is it implemented? 
- Applying linear regression to the data.And we should not misuse the data.
What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- The data is fake, and we shoule gain real data from experiments.
How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
- Pressure of the air is directly proportionaly to the temperature. Therfore, when we store gas tanks, we should advisely store them in cool place to avoid excess pressure in tanks.
